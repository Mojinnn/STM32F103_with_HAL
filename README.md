# STM32F103 with HAL

## Overview Description:
- There are some little projects with STM32F103C8T6 with the HAL library
- I got this document from HCMUT Labs through my friend to self-learn and acquaint myself with STM32
- I don't follow all the document's exercises, but I summarize with some key projects that I think are enough
- All projects are simulated with Proteus 8 Professional
